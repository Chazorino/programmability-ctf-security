In this Stage, you should:
* Get all event types from AMP
* Check `Malware Executed` Events that have occured on the Host `Demo_AMP_Threat_Audit` 
* Save the SHA-256 of the Malware file for later use
* Isolate the host through AMP. Be aware that it could already be isolated due to the shared environment
